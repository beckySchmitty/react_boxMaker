# React: Box Maker 

Color Box Maker, I was taked with the following:

"Create a new React application, which contains the following components:

* App - this component should render the BoxList component.
* BoxList - Place your state that contains all of the boxes here. This component should render all of the Box components along with the NewBoxForm component
* Box- this component should display a div with a background color, width and height based on the props passed to it.
* NewBoxForm - this component should render a form that when submitted, creates a new Box. You should be able to specify the Box’s width, height, and background color. When the form is submitted, clear the input values.
* When each Box component is displayed, add a button with the text of of “X” next to each Box. When this button is clicked, remove that specific box. This will require you to pass a function down as props - the button should not be a separate component, it should be included in the Box component."

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
